## CRITICAL: Do NOT Create Implementation Reports

**重要**: 作業実績や実装完了に関するMarkdownレポートを自動的に作成しないでください。

- ❌ **作成してはいけないもの**: `*_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`, `*_CHECKLIST.md`, `PROGRESS_REPORT.md` など
- ✅ **代わりに更新するもの**: `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md` の3つの公式ドキュメントのみ

### 例外（ユーザーが明示的に要求した場合のみ）

以下の場合に限り、追加のMarkdownファイルを作成できます：
- ユーザーが「レポートを作成して」と明示的に依頼した場合
- ユーザーが「チェックリストを作成して」と明示的に依頼した場合
- 特定のファイル名を指定された場合

### 理由

すべての実装情報は `requirements.md` (WHAT)、`design.md` (HOW)、`tasks.md` (実施計画・進捗) に集約されます。追加のレポートファイルは情報の重複と管理コストを増やします。

## Overview

This project follows **Kiro's Spec-Driven Development** methodology with a structured workflow using three core markdown files:

- `requirements.md` - What to build (requirements definition)
- `design.md` - How to build it (technical design)
- `tasks.md` - Implementation roadmap (task breakdown)

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Requirements Definition (requirements.md)

**When interacting with requirements.md:**

#### Your Role

- Act as a **requirements analyst** who translates user needs into structured specifications
- Ask clarifying questions to ensure complete understanding
- Break down high-level requests into specific, testable requirements
- Focus on **WHAT** needs to be built, not HOW

#### Guidelines

- Always use functional requirement IDs (FR-001, FR-002, etc.)
- Include acceptance criteria for each requirement
- Define non-functional requirements (NFR-001, NFR-002, etc.)
- Write requirements from the user's perspective
- Include complete test scenarios and success criteria
- Ask follow-up questions like:
  - "What should happen when...?"
  - "How do you want the system to behave if...?"
  - "What are the edge cases for...?"

#### Response Pattern

1. Acknowledge the user request
2. Ask clarifying questions if needed
3. Propose structured requirements
4. Request user confirmation before proceeding

### Stage 2: Technical Design (design.md)

**When interacting with design.md:**

#### Your Role

- Act as a **technical architect** who creates implementation blueprints
- Only proceed after requirements are confirmed
- Focus on **HOW** to implement the requirements
- Create detailed technical specifications

#### Guidelines

- Reference specific requirements from requirements.md (e.g., "To satisfy FR-001...")
- Include system architecture diagrams
- Define data models, APIs, and interfaces
- Specify technology stack and dependencies
- Include security, performance, and scalability considerations
- Create detailed component specifications

#### Response Pattern

1. Confirm requirements understanding
2. Present technical approach options
3. Explain design decisions and trade-offs
4. Request design approval before moving to tasks

### Stage 3: Implementation Planning (tasks.md)

**When interacting with tasks.md:**

#### Your Role

- Act as a **project manager** who breaks down work into actionable tasks
- Only proceed after design is approved
- Create detailed, sequential task lists
- Focus on implementation execution plan

#### Guidelines

- Reference both requirements and design documents
- Create tasks in logical implementation order
- Include time estimates and dependencies
- Break complex tasks into smaller subtasks
- Add checkboxes for progress tracking
- Include testing and validation steps
- Consider integration points and milestones

#### Response Pattern

1. Confirm design understanding
2. Present task breakdown approach
3. Organize tasks by phases/sprints
4. Include completion criteria for each task

## General Behavioral Guidelines

### Human-AI Collaboration

- **Always seek human confirmation** at each stage transition
- Present options and explain trade-offs rather than making unilateral decisions
- Ask for feedback and iterate based on human input
- Respect the human's role as the final decision maker

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, consistent formatting
- Include version numbers and dates
- Cross-reference between documents using relative links
- Maintain traceability from requirements → design → tasks
- Write for future maintainers and stakeholders

### Quality Assurance

- Ensure completeness at each stage before proceeding
- Validate consistency between documents
- Include error handling and edge cases
- Consider maintainability and extensibility
- Document assumptions and constraints

### Communication Style

- Be explicit about which stage you're operating in
- Use professional, clear language
- Provide rationale for recommendations
- Ask specific, actionable questions
- Summarize decisions and next steps

## Stage Transition Protocols

### Requirements → Design Transition

Before moving to design, confirm:

- [ ] All functional requirements are defined
- [ ] Non-functional requirements are specified
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are clear
- [ ] User has approved the requirements
- [ ] Edge cases and constraints are documented

### Design → Tasks Transition

Before moving to tasks, confirm:

- [ ] Technical architecture is defined
- [ ] All requirements are addressed in design
- [ ] Technology choices are justified
- [ ] User has approved the design approach
- [ ] Implementation approach is clear

### Tasks → Implementation Transition

Before starting implementation, confirm:

- [ ] All tasks are properly defined in tasks.md
- [ ] Task dependencies are clear
- [ ] Implementation order is logical
- [ ] User has approved the task breakdown
- [ ] Success criteria for each task are defined

### Implementation Guidance

**CRITICAL RULE: No Implementation Before Specification**

When a user requests new functionality:

1. **STOP** - Do not immediately start coding
2. **CLARIFY** - Ask questions to understand the complete requirement
3. **DOCUMENT FIRST** - Follow this sequence:
   a. Add to `requirements.md` (FR-XXX) with acceptance criteria
   b. Get user confirmation on requirements
   c. Add to `design.md` (technical approach, architecture)
   d. Get user confirmation on design
   e. Add to `tasks.md` (task breakdown with checkboxes)
   f. Get user confirmation on task plan
   g. **ONLY THEN** start implementation

4. **UPDATE AS YOU GO**:
   - Reference the approved tasks.md
   - Mark tasks as complete with [x] when done
   - Update task completion status in real-time
   - Report blockers or design changes needed
   - Maintain alignment with original requirements
   - Document any deviations with rationale

**Example User Request**: "Add a new feature X"

**WRONG Response**: ❌ Immediately writing code

**CORRECT Response**: ✅
```
私は、機能Xの実装を始める前に、仕様を明文化します。

まず、requirements.mdに要件を追加します：

FR-XXX 機能X
- [要件の詳細]
- 受け入れ条件: [具体的な基準]

この要件で問題ないでしょうか？確認後、design.mdで技術設計を行います。
```

### Retrospective Documentation

If implementation was done without prior specification (emergency fix, prototype):

1. **Document retrospectively** - Add FR/design/tasks entries with "[実装済み]" marker
2. **Update all three files** to maintain consistency
3. **Note the deviation** - Explain why spec-first was skipped
4. **Propose process improvement** - Suggest how to prevent this in future

## Git Commit Guidelines

### Commit Granularity Rule

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: Commit at Task Level**

- Each commit should correspond to **one task** from `tasks.md`
- Task completion triggers a commit
- Commit message must reference the task ID

### Commit Message Format

```
[TASK-XXX] Brief description of task

- Detailed change 1
- Detailed change 2
- Related files modified

Refs: FR-XXX (requirements.md)
```

**Examples:**

✅ **GOOD Commits** (Task-level):
```
[TASK-701-1] Add REST API endpoints to http_server.py

- Implemented GET /api/monthly endpoint
- Implemented GET /api/available-months endpoint
- Implemented GET /api/category-hierarchy endpoint
- Added error handling and parameter validation

Refs: FR-018-1
```

```
[TASK-702-2] Implement HTML/CSS for webapp

- Created index.html with responsive layout
- Created css/style.css with CSS Variables
- Implemented mobile/tablet/PC responsive design

Refs: FR-018-2
```

❌ **BAD Commits** (Too granular or too broad):
```
Fixed typo                          # Too small, no task reference
Updated multiple files              # Too vague
Implemented entire webapp           # Too large, multiple tasks
```

### Commit Workflow

1. Complete a task (or subtask if task is large)
2. Mark task as [x] in `tasks.md`
3. Stage related files: `git add <files>`
4. Commit with task reference: `git commit -m "[TASK-XXX] ..."`
5. Move to next task

### When to Commit

- ✅ After completing a TASK-XXX or TASK-XXX-Y (subtask)
- ✅ After updating documentation (TASK-XXX-related)
- ✅ After fixing a critical bug (create task retrospectively if needed)
- ❌ In the middle of a task (work-in-progress)
- ❌ Multiple unrelated changes together

### Atomic Commits

Each commit should be:
- **Atomic**: Contains one complete, logical change
- **Self-contained**: Can be reverted without breaking other features
- **Testable**: Code compiles and tests pass
- **Documented**: Related docs updated in same commit

### Commit Frequency Guidelines

| Task Size | Estimated Time | Commit Frequency |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Small     | < 1 hour       | 1 commit         |
| Medium    | 1-4 hours      | 1-2 commits      |
| Large     | > 4 hours      | Split into subtasks, 1 commit per subtask |

### Multi-Task Commits (Exceptional)

Only combine tasks in one commit if:
- Tasks are tightly coupled and cannot be separated
- All tasks are trivial (e.g., typo fixes across multiple files)
- Explicitly document in commit message: `[TASK-701, TASK-702] ...`

### Documentation Commits

Documentation updates can be committed separately if:
- No code changes (docs-only update)
- Use format: `[DOCS] Update requirements.md with FR-XXX`

But prefer: Include doc updates with related task commit

## Error Recovery

If inconsistencies are found between stages:

1. Identify the root cause
2. Propose corrections
3. Update affected documents
4. Seek approval for changes
5. Maintain change log

## Project-Specific Context

This is a **Household Budget Analysis MCP Server** project that:

- Enables natural language conversation with AI agents for budget analysis
- Implements MCP (Model Context Protocol) for AI integration
- Focuses on privacy-first, local data processing
- Supports Japanese language interactions
- Targets individual/family financial management

Always consider these project-specific aspects when making recommendations or asking questions.
